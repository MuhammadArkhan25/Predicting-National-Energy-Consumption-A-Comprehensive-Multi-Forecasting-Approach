# Predicting-National-Energy-Consumption-A-Comprehensive-Multi-Forecasting-Approach
This project focuses on predicting national energy consumption for various countries over the next five years using a comprehensive multi-forecasting approach. By analyzing historical energy consumption data, the project employs and compares several forecasting models to determine the most accurate method for future energy needs.
# Key Features:
- Data Source: Historical energy consumption data for multiple countries.
- Forecasting Models:
    a.ARIMA: Captures temporal dependencies.
    b.Prophet: Handles seasonality and holidays.
    c.Darts: Offers a range of models including neural networks and traditional methods.
- Prediction Horizon: Forecasts for the next five years.
- Evaluation Metrics: Assesses performance using Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
