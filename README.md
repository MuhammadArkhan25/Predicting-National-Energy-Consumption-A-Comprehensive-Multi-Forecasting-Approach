# Predicting National Energy Consumption: A Comprehensive Multi-Forecasting Approach

## Description

This project aims to predict national energy consumption for various countries over the next five years using a comprehensive multi-forecasting approach. The notebook leverages historical energy consumption data and applies three forecasting models—ARIMA, Prophet, and Darts—to evaluate their performance and determine the most effective method for future predictions.

### Key Features:
- **Data Source**: Historical energy consumption data.
- **Forecasting Models**:
  - **ARIMA**: A classical time series model for capturing temporal dependencies.
  - **Prophet**: Developed by Facebook, designed to handle seasonality and holidays.
  - **Darts**: A modern library that supports a range of models including neural networks.
